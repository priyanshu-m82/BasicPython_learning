This repository contains my early learning in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.  
It includes basic concepts, practice exercises, and foundational code snippets as I begin exploring the language.

##  Notebook: `basic_python.ipynb`

### Topics covered so far:
- Using the `print()` function
- Declaring variables
- Storing strings and integers
- String formatting with f-strings

```python
print("python")
age = 19
name = "python"
print(age)
print(name)
print("age is --", age, ",", "name is --", name)

# Using f-string
print(f"Age is: {age}\nName is: {name}")

Goal

This notebook is a record of my personal learning journey with Python â€” starting from the basics and gradually building toward more advanced topics.
